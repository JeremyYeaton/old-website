## About me
I am a PhD student in [Language Science](https://www.langsci.uci.edu/) at the University of California, Irvine. I'm generally interested in how language is stored, structured, and processed in the brain. At the moment, I'm working on the lemma level (i.e.: the representation of words in the brain before you put sounds to them).
<!--- I'm interested in how meaning and structure in language are represented in the brain, especially the processes used to combine smaller units (e.g.: phonemes, words) into larger units (e.g.: words, phrases) in real time. Methodologically, I'm interested in exploring how we can use novel combinations of experimental and computational tools to probe these representations and processes. What do I do; what am i interested in? --->

<!--- , and am fascinated with how meaning and structure in language are represented in the brain, as well as how the representations of languages might interact in speakers (or signers) who know more than one. My [master's thesis](https://jeremyyeaton.github.io/papers/Yeaton_MasterThesis.pdf) was on the impact of proficiency and executive functioning on the processing of syntactic (in this case word order) violations in a second language.   --->

After growing up in New Jersey, I double majored in [Linguistics](https://sites.google.com/site/experimentalsyntax4/home) & French, and minored in Chinese at Rutgers University - New Brunswick. After graduating, I worked for a year at the US Department of State's [School of Language Studies](https://www.state.gov/m/fsi/sls/) outside Washington, DC, spent a year in [Haskovo (Хасково)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskovo), Bulgaria teaching English to high schoolers on a [Fulbright](http://www.fulbright.bg/en/) grant, and then moved to Paris to complete my master's degree in Cognitive Science at the [École Normale Supérieure](https://cognition.ens.fr/en). After finishing my master's, I moved to Marseille, France where I worked as the Biological Signal Processing and Data Analysis Engineer for Jonathan Grainger's [ERC Advanced Grant](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/212046/factsheet/en) within the [Cognitive Psychology Lab](https://lpc.univ-amu.fr/en) at Aix-Marseille University. In that role, I analyzed EEG and eye-tracking data from experiments that pertain to orthographic, lexical, and sentence-level processing in reading. 
<!--- I also did a cool study with baboons. --->
