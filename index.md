## About me
I'm a second-year master's student in Cognitive Science at the [École Normale Supérieure](https://cognition.ens.fr/en) in Paris, and am fascinated with how meaning and structure in language are represented in the brain, as well as how the representations of languages might interact in speakers (or signers) who know more than one.

Before starting my master's, I double majored in [Linguistics](https://sites.google.com/site/experimentalsyntax4/home) and French, and minored in Chinese at Rutgers University - New Brunswick. After graduating, I worked for a year at the US Department of State's [School of Language Studies](https://www.state.gov/m/fsi/sls/) outside Washington, DC. The next year I lived in [Haskovo (Хасково)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskovo), Bulgaria and taught English to high schoolers on a [Fulbright](http://www.fulbright.bg/en/) grant.

My master's thesis is an experimental project examining the impact of proficiency and executive functioning on the processing of syntactic (in this case word order) violations in second language processing. [See here](https://JeremyYeaton.github.io/research) for some of my other projects.
