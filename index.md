## About me
I'm a second-year master's student in Cognitive Science at the Ecole normale superieure in Paris.

My master's thesis is an experimental project examining the impact of proficiency and executive functioning on the processing of syntactic (in this case word order) violations in second language processing. See below for some of my other current projects.

Before starting my master's, I double majored in Linguistics and French, and minored in Chinese at Rutgers University - New Brunswick. After graduating, I worked for a year at the US Department of State's language school outside Washington, DC for a year. The next year I lived in Haskovo, Bulgaria and taught English to high schoolers on a Fulbright grant.
