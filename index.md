## About me
I am currently the Biological Signal Processing and Data Analysis Engineer for the language team at the [Cognitive Psychology Lab](https://lpc.univ-amu.fr/en) at Aix-Marseille University in Marseille, France. I analyze EEG and eye-tracking data from experiments that pertain to orthographic, lexical, and sentence-level processing as a part of Jonathan Grainger's [ERC Advanced Grant](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/212046/factsheet/en).

I'm interested in how meaning and structure in language are represented in the brain, as well as exploring how we can use existing and novel experimental tools and paradigms to probe these representations.

A native of New Jersey, I double majored in [Linguistics](https://sites.google.com/site/experimentalsyntax4/home) and French, and minored in Chinese at Rutgers University - New Brunswick. After graduating, I worked for a year at the US Department of State's [School of Language Studies](https://www.state.gov/m/fsi/sls/) outside Washington, DC, spent a year in [Haskovo (Хасково)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskovo), Bulgaria teaching English to high schoolers on a [Fulbright](http://www.fulbright.bg/en/) grant, and then moved to Paris to complete my master's degree in Cognitive Science at the [École Normale Supérieure](https://cognition.ens.fr/en). My master's thesis is on the impact of proficiency and executive functioning on the processing of syntactic (in this case word order) violations in a second language.
