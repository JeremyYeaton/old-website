## Research projects
I am interested in how the structure of language is represented in the brain, especially in language users who can speak (or sign) more than one language.

### Current projects
- Since 2012, I have been working with Prof. Viviane Deprez at Rutgers University on questions of negation, particularly negative concord.
- Giovanni, semantics and phonetics
- Isel, ERPs and executive functioning
