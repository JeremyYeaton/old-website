## Collaborate with me!


I'm always open to new collaborations! **Do you have a laboratory experiment you'd like to do in any of the following domains?**
- (Psycho) Linguistics

**But you don't have a lab engineer or graduate student for the project?** No problem!

**I can serve as your offsite lab engineer, providing the following services:**
- Experimental design consulatation
- Programming experimental task(s) in e.g.: PsychToolbox, exPyriment, OpenSesame
- On-site installations & training research assistants
- Data processing and analysis

- Writing up Methods and Results sections


What I (usually) don't do:
- Stimulus creation

All of this is negotiable. If you think you'd like to collaborate, send me an [email](mailto:jdyeaton27@gmail.com) and we can work out the details!
