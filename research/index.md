- **Natural story reading in a co-registration paradigm:** With [Jonathan Grainger](https://lpc.univ-amu.fr/fr/profile/grainger-jonathan) and the Language team at the [Laboratoire de Psychologie Cognitive](https://lpc.univ-amu.fr/en) at Aix-Marseille Université, I am spearheading a project to investigate oculometric and EEG responses to natural reading of a story. While other neurophysiological studies have examined story reading, this study introduces a new paradigm allowing participants to read in a more natural fashion than the traditional serial presentation paradigm where single words appearing on the center of the screen one after another.

- **Syntax-pragmatics-prosody interface in negation:** Since 2012, I have been working with [Viviane Déprez](https://www.sites.google.com/site/experimentalsyntax4/customization) at Rutgers University on questions of negation, particularly negative concord in French (including writing my [undergraduate thesis](https://JeremyYeaton.github.io/files/Yeaton_UndergradThesis.pdf) on the topic). We have conducted a number of behavioral and [production studies](https://JeremyYeaton.github.io/files/lsrl_46.pdf) investigating the roles syntax, pragmatics, and prosody play in disambiguating a series of multiple negative expressions, like _personne ne boit rien_ (nobody drinks nothing). So far we have found that negative concord does not appear to be the default reading in French, and that sometimes double negation can be preferred. This is highly subject to context, however. <!--Results from this work have been presented at LSRL 46 at Stony Brook, [ConSOLE 26](https://jeremyyeaton.github.io/files/console_2018.pdf) in London, and [AMBIGO](https://jeremyyeaton.github.io/slides/ambigo2018_web.pdf) in Goettingen.-->

- **Parallel syntactic processing in reading:** With [Stephane Dufau](https://lpc.univ-amu.fr/fr/profile/dufau-stephane) and [Jonathan Grainger](https://lpc.univ-amu.fr/fr/profile/grainger-jonathan), we are using MEG to more closely examine where and when effects arise in response to syntactictically well-formed and not well formed strings of the same words presented very briefly in parallel. The MEG study presents a follow up to [this ERP study](https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2020-03640-001.html) from our team which was published earlier in 2020.

- **L1 interference in L2 processing:** With [Yaru Wu](https://yaruwucven.wordpress.com/) and [Frederic Isel](https://modyco.fr/fr/component/jsn/Frederic.html), we are conducting an ERP study examining whether phonological similarity of translation equivalents (in the L2) of two words in the L1 helps facilitate their processing, without relying on semantic similarity.

- **Syntactic, semantic, and phonological violations in sign language:** Under the direction of [Caroline Bogliotti](https://caroline-bogliotti.parisnanterre.fr/), I am helping to conduct two EEG studies. The first seeks to examine ERPs (P600) in response to syntactically ill-formed sentences presented in French sign language. The other seeks to elicit semantic and phonological incongruency ERPs in the same paradigm.

<!--- **Sign language perception:** Under the direction of [Giovanni Di Liberto](https://lsp.dec.ens.fr/en/member/7735/giovanni-di-liberto), [Carlo Geraci](https://sites.google.com/site/carlogeraci76/), and [Jeremy Kuhn](http://jeremykuhn.net/), we will record EEG while signers watch videos of stories presented in French Sign Language (Langue des Signes Française--LSF). We can then compare the phonetic, semantic, and syntactic features of the stimuli to their EEG signals and examine a) where and when these are represented in the brain, and b) if and how the tracking of these linguistic features in the visual modality differs from speech in the auditory modality. -->

- **Naturalistic speech perception in bilinguals:** Under the direction of [Giovanni Di Liberto](https://www.diliberg.net/) and in collaboration with [Nima Mesgarani](http://nima.ee.columbia.edu/), I am investigating how [modulated semantic surprisal](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/193201v1.full) can be observed in the EEG signals of native and non-native speakers listening to continuous, natural speech. The main methodology we use is the _multivariate Temporal Response Function_ [(mTRF)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27965557) which allows us to compare an EEG signal to a continuous speech stream, instead of brief discretized events as in ERPs. We are also looking at whether these and other measures can be used to decode proficiency from an EEG signal.<!-- Results from this work have been presented at [SNL 2019](https://jeremyyeaton.github.io/slides/posterSNL_final.pdf) in Helsinki, and [SfN19](https://jeremyyeaton.github.io/slides/SfN2019_L1L2.pdf) in Chicago.-->

- **Impact of parafoveal (next) word on processing fixated word:** In a [recent paper](https://JeremyYeaton.github.io/papers/Mirault_et_al-2020-Psychophysiology.pdf) with [Jonathan Mirault](https://sites.google.com/view/jonathan-mirault/about-me?authuser=0), [Jonathan Grainger](https://lpc.univ-amu.fr/fr/profile/grainger-jonathan), [Stephane Dufau](https://lpc.univ-amu.fr/fr/profile/dufau-stephane), and [Phil Holcomb](https://psychology.sdsu.edu/phillip-holcomb-ph-d/), we found that neural responses in reading a given word in a sentence (word n) are impacted by the nature of the next word (word n + 1), providing evidence for parallel processing in reading. EEG analysis code available [here](https://github.com/JeremyYeaton/OPOF_Mirault2020).

- **Proficiency and executive functioning in L2 syntactic processing:** For my [Master's thesis](https://JeremyYeaton.github.io/papers/Yeaton_MasterThesis.pdf) under the direction of [Frederic Isel](https://modyco.fr/fr/component/jsn/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric.html) at the University of Paris-Nanterre, I conducted a pilot [replication](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bilingualism-language-and-cognition/article/language-background-affects-online-word-order-processing-in-a-second-language-but-not-offline/2BA69A093E765439D5FA7083E9547BD6) conducted by a team at the [Lund University Humanities Lab](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/lucat/group/v1000037) in Sweden which found that online responses (ERPs) to syntactic (word order) violations in L2 differed depending on whether the L1 has the same word order, while offline performance was not significantly different. As such, even if L2 speakers seem to produce the language with comparable levels of accuracy, they still do not process it in the same way. My project sought to replicate these results in native French speakers, and probe further, investigating how the effect is modulated by proficiency, and some measures of executive functioning like inhibition control and selective attention. This can help provide insight into how the L1 grammar and other cognitive factors might impact syntactic processing in an L2.

- **Representaion of speech sounds in L1 and L2:** Under the direction of [Giovanni Di Liberto](https://www.diliberg.net/), I conducted a pilot EEG study looking at how the [representation of speech sounds](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26412129) differs in native and non-native speakers. The sample size was quite small, but the results provide a promising direction for future research.

- **Negative concord in English:** Based on the behavioral and production study [Viviane Deprez](https://www.sites.google.com/site/experimentalsyntax4/customization) and I did in French, [Frances Blanchette](https://cls.la.psu.edu/people/fkb), worked with us to adapt the paradigm to [use in English](https://JeremyYeaton.github.io/files/LSA2018_EnglishNCandDN.pdf). We found that native English speakers can access negative concord interpretations much more than previously thought and that context and prosody also play a major role in determining these interpretations.
