## Current projects
- **Naturalistic speech and EEG in bilinguals:** Under the direction of [Giovanni Di Liberto](https://lsp.dec.ens.fr/en/member/7735/giovanni-di-liberto) and in collaboration with [Nima Mesgarani](http://nima.ee.columbia.edu/), I am investigating how [modulated semantic surprisal](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/193201v1.full) can be observed in the EEG signals of native and non-native speakers listening to continuous, natural speech. The main methodology we use is the _multivariate Temporal Response Function_ [(mTRF)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27965557) which allows us to compare an EEG signal to a continuous speech stream, instead of brief discretized events as in ERPs. We are also looking at whether these and other measures can be used to decode proficiency from an EEG signal. Results from this work have been presented at [SNL 2019](https://jeremyyeaton.github.io/slides/posterSNL_final.pdf) in Helsinki, and [SfN19](https://jeremyyeaton.github.io/slides/SfN2019_L1L2.pdf) in Chicago. - NS, EEG, Speech, Bil

- **Syntax-pragmatics-prosody interface in negation:** Since 2012, I have been working with [Viviane Déprez](https://www.sites.google.com/site/experimentalsyntax4/customization) at Rutgers University on questions of negation, particularly negative concord in French (including writing my [undergraduate thesis](https://JeremyYeaton.github.io/files/Yeaton_UndergradThesis.pdf) on the topic). We have conducted a number of behavioral and [production studies](https://JeremyYeaton.github.io/files/lsrl_46.pdf) investigating the roles syntax, pragmatics, and prosody play in disambiguating a series of multiple negative expressions, like _personne ne boit rien_ (nobody drinks nothing). So far we have found that negative concord does not appear to be the default reading in French, and that sometimes double negation can be preferred. This is highly subject to context, however. Results from this work have been presented at LSRL 46 at Stony Brook, [ConSOLE 26](https://jeremyyeaton.github.io/files/console_2018.pdf) in London, and [AMBIGO](https://jeremyyeaton.github.io/slides/ambigo2018_web.pdf) in Goettingen. - Ling, prosody, syntax, neg

<!--- **Parafoveal-on-foveal (POF) effects in reading:** Results from this work were presented at ESCoP
When reading, can the next word in the sentence (word n+1) influence how you read the word you are currently looking at (word n)? Serial models of sentence reading state that this generally should not be the case, whereas parallel models predict that this should be the case. Here we focus on perhaps the simplest and the strongest Parafoveal-on-Foveal (PoF) manipulation: word n +1 is either the same as word n or a different word. Participants read sentences for comprehension, and when their eyes left word n, the repeated or unrelated word at position n +1 were swapped for a word that provided a syntactically correct continuation of the sentence. We recorded EEG and eye-movements, and time-locked the analysis of fixation-related-potentials (FRPs) to fixation of word n. We found robust PoF repetition effects on gaze durations on word n, and also on the initial landing position on word n. Most important is that we also observed significant effects in FRPs, reaching significance at 260 ms post-fixation of word n. Repetition of the target word n at position n+1 caused a widely distributed reduced negativity in the FRPs. Given the timing of this effect we argue that it is driven by orthographic processing of word n+1 while readers were still looking at word n, plus the spatial integration of orthographic information extracted from these two words in parallel. - CR, EEG, reading	--->

- **Syntactic, semantic, and phonological violations in sign language:** Under the direction of [Caroline Bogliotti](https://caroline-bogliotti.parisnanterre.fr/), I am helping to conduct two EEG studies. The first seeks to examine ERPs (P600) in response to syntactically ill-formed sentences presented in French sign language. The other seeks to elicit semantic and phonological incongruency ERPs in the same paradigm. - EEG, syntax, SL, Ling

- **Proficiency and executive functioning in L2 syntactic processing:** For my Master's thesis under the direction of [Frederic Isel](https://modyco.fr/fr/component/jsn/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric.html) at the University of Paris-Nanterre, I conducted a pilot [replication](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bilingualism-language-and-cognition/article/language-background-affects-online-word-order-processing-in-a-second-language-but-not-offline/2BA69A093E765439D5FA7083E9547BD6) conducted by a team at the [Lund University Humanities Lab](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/lucat/group/v1000037) in Sweden which found that online responses (ERPs) to syntactic (word order) violations in L2 differed depending on whether the L1 has the same word order, while offline performance was not significantly different. As such, even if L2 speakers seem to produce the language with comparable levels of accuracy, they still do not process it in the same way. My project sought to replicate these results in native French speakers, and probe further, investigating how the effect is modulated by proficiency, and some measures of executive functioning like inhibition control and selective attention. This can help provide insight into how the L1 grammar and other cognitive factors might impact syntactic processing in an L2. - EEG, syntax, Ling, bil

- **Naturalistic stimuli and EEG in sign language:** Under the direction of [Giovanni Di Liberto](https://lsp.dec.ens.fr/en/member/7735/giovanni-di-liberto), [Carlo Geraci](https://sites.google.com/site/carlogeraci76/), and [Jeremy Kuhn](http://jeremykuhn.net/), we will record EEG while signers watch videos of stories presented in French Sign Language (Langue des Signes Française--LSF). We can then compare the phonetic, semantic, and syntactic features of the stimuli to their EEG signals and examine a) where and when these are represented in the brain, and b) if and how the tracking of these linguistic features in the visual modality differs from speech in the auditory modality. - NS, EEG, SL

- **Naturalistic reading in a co-registration paradigm:** With [Jonathan Grainger](https://lpc.univ-amu.fr/fr/profile/grainger-jonathan) and the Language team at the [Laboratoire de Psychologie Cognitive](https://lpc.univ-amu.fr/en)  at Aix-Marseille Université, I am spearheading a project to investigate oculometric and EEG responses to sentence reading as part of a story. By co-registering eye-tracking and EEG data, we can use the eye-tracking data to establish when the eyes fixate on a given word and then look at the EEG responses from that point. While other studies have examined story reading, this study introduces a new paradigm allowing participants to read in a more natural fashion than single words appearing on the center of the screen one after another. - NS, CR, EEG, reading

- **Representaion of speech sounds in L1 and L2:** Under the direction of [Giovanni Di Liberto](https://lsp.dec.ens.fr/en/member/7735/giovanni-di-liberto), I conducted a pilot EEG study looking at how the [representation of speech sounds](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26412129) differs in native and non-native speakers. The sample size was quite small, but the results provide a promising direction for future research. - NS, EEG, Bil

- **Negative concord in English:** Based on the behavioral and production study [Viviane Deprez](https://www.sites.google.com/site/experimentalsyntax4/customization) and I did in French, [Frances Blanchette](https://cls.la.psu.edu/people/fkb), worked with us to adapt the paradigm to [use in English](https://JeremyYeaton.github.io/files/LSA2018_EnglishNCandDN.pdf). We found that native English speakers can access negative concord interpretations much more than previously thought and that context and prosody also play a major role in determining these interpretations. - Ling, neg, syntax, prosody
